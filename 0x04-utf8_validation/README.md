0x04. UTF-8 Validation
Description: Master UTF-8 validation in this project. Learn the importance of proper encoding and validation for UTF-8 data. Understand the UTF-8 character encoding standard for handling Unicode characters. Explore techniques to verify the correctness of UTF-8 encoded data. Identify common errors and implement effective validation methods.

Concepts Needed:
Bitwise Operations in Python:

Understanding how to manipulate bits in Python, including operations like AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), shifts (<<, >>).
Python Bitwise Operators
UTF-8 Encoding Scheme:

Familiarity with the UTF-8 encoding rules, including how characters are encoded into one or more bytes.
Understanding the patterns that represent a valid UTF-8 encoded character.
UTF-8 Wikipedia
Characters, Symbols, and the Unicode Miracle
The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets
Data Representation:

How to represent and work with data at the byte level.
Handling the least significant bits (LSB) of integers to simulate byte data.
List Manipulation in Python:

Iterating through lists, accessing list elements, and understanding list comprehensions.
Python Lists
Boolean Logic:

Applying logical operations to make decisions within the program.
By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you will be equipped to tackle the UTF-8 validation project, effectively applying bitwise operations and logical reasoning to determine the validity of UTF-8 encoded data.
